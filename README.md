# iPhone Backup Decoder and Analyzer

# Requires:

* MacOsX utility plutil. So right now this software is Mac only, until I find an alternative to plutil.

* Python Tkinter library See http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter for details about the installation. On MacOsX the Tkinter framework is installed along with ActiveTcl http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/

* Python Imaging Library (PIL). Download from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
	python setup.py build
